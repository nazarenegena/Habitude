__Technologies__
----------------

--Next.js:--

Why: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and a powerful development experience. It's great for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications.

--React--:

Why: React is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Since Next.js is built on top of React, I will be using React components to structure my app.

--Tailwind CSS--:

Why: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps build stylish and responsive interfaces without writing custom CSS. It integrates seamlessly with Next.js.

--External Tools for Data Management--:
Why: External tools such as headless CMS (Content Management System) can make managing and updating content easier without directly modifying the code.

--External APIs--:

Why: External APIs can provide additional features and data for your app, such as weather information, motivational quotes, or community support.

--Authentication--:

Why: Habitude requires user accounts or personalized data thus implementing authentication is crucial.

--GraphQL--:
Why: GraphQL can simplify data fetching and provide a more efficient way to query and update data from external APIs.

--Database (Optional)--:
Why: Habitude involves user-specific data storage, hence integrating a database might be necessary.
